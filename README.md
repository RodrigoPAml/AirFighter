# Air Fighter

Air Fighter is a 2D air combat game developed to validate the Box Engine in its 2D aspect.

The Box Engine is a game engine developed in C++ that uses a game object architecture (based on Unity) and Lua as the scripting language.

You can find the Box Engine repository [here](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/BoxEngine).

The game features two levels, facing the enemy fleet, and finally, after drawing enough attention, confronting the game boss.

Available in 5 difficulties (Rookie, Wingman, Veteran, Ace, and God).
